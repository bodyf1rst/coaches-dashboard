# Coaches Dashboard & API Audit Report
**Date:** October 6, 2025, 3:03 AM
**Status:** CRITICAL CONFIGURATION ISSUES FOUND

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. **CONFLICTING API CONFIGURATION**
**Problem:** Angular dashboard is configured to use wrong API endpoint

**Current State:**
- `environment.ts` points to: `http://localhost:3001`
- This expects a local Node.js API server to be running
- The `local-api/server.js` creates a Node.js proxy to RDS database
- **BUT** we already have a working EC2 PHP API at `http://18.205.116.101`

**Issue:**
- TWO DIFFERENT APIs trying to do the same thing
- Redundant code and potential confusion
- Local API requires starting BOTH Angular dev server AND Node.js API server
- EC2 API is already deployed, tested, and working with 747 videos

**Impact:** Dashboard will fail to load videos unless local API is also running on port 3001

---

### 2. **REDUNDANT LOCAL API**
**Location:** `coaches-dashboard/local-api/server.js`

**What it does:**
- Runs on port 3001
- Connects to same RDS database as EC2
- Has IDENTICAL thumbnail fix logic (strips "(360p)" suffix)
- Returns videos in same format as EC2 API

**Problem:**
- Completely redundant - EC2 API already does all of this
- Adds unnecessary complexity
- Requires running an extra server locally
- Has hardcoded database credentials (security risk)

---

### 3. **TYPESCRIPT COMPILATION WARNINGS**
**From Angular build output:**
- Multiple "optional chain" warnings (non-critical, code style)
- CommonJS dependency warnings for `quill` and `moment` (optimization warnings)
- These are NOT blocking issues, just optimization suggestions

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-critical, app compiles successfully

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING CORRECTLY

### EC2 API
- **URL:** `http://18.205.116.101/get-videos.php`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed and working
- **Test Result:** Returns 747 videos with corrected thumbnail URLs
- **Thumbnail Fix:** Strips "(360p)" suffixes correctly
- **Database:** Connected to RDS successfully

### PHP API Code
- **Location:** `../BodyF1rst-APIs/public/get-videos.php`
- Clean, well-structured code
- Proper CORS headers
- Correct thumbnail URL generation with fallbacks

---

## üîß RECOMMENDED FIX

### Option 1: Use EC2 API Directly (RECOMMENDED)
Update Angular environment to point to EC2:

```typescript
// coaches-dashboard/src/environments/environment.ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://18.205.116.101'
};
```

**Pros:**
- Uses already-deployed and tested API
- No need to run local API server
- Simpler architecture
- One source of truth

**Cons:**
- Requires EC2 to be running (already is)
- Network dependency for local development

### Option 2: Keep Local API (NOT RECOMMENDED)
- Requires starting TWO servers every time
- Redundant code maintenance
- Security risk (hardcoded credentials in repo)

---

## üìã CLEAN STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS

### After Applying Fix (Option 1):

1. **Update Environment File:**
   ```bash
   # Edit: coaches-dashboard/src/environments/environment.ts
   # Change apiUrl from 'http://localhost:3001' to 'http://18.205.116.101'
   ```

2. **Start Angular Dev Server:**
   ```bash
   cd coaches-dashboard
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open Browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:4200
   ```

4. **Test Video Library:**
   ```
   http://localhost:4200/video-library
   ```

**That's it! No need for local-api server.**

---

## üìä FILES AUDIT SUMMARY

### ‚úÖ Clean Files (No Issues)
- `src/app/app.component.ts` - Standard Angular component
- `src/app/app.module.ts` - Properly configured
- `src/app/pages/video-library/video-library.component.ts` - Uses http.service correctly
- `src/app/service/s3-video.service.ts` - S3 integration looks good

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Files Needing Attention
- `src/environments/environment.ts` - **MUST FIX:** Wrong API URL
- `local-api/server.js` - **CONSIDER REMOVING:** Redundant, has security issues

### üîí Security Concerns
- **File:** `local-api/server.js`
- **Issue:** Hardcoded RDS credentials
- **Recommendation:** If keeping local-api, move credentials to .env file
- **Better:** Remove local-api entirely and use EC2 API

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. **Apply the fix** (update environment.ts)
2. **Test the dashboard** with EC2 API
3. **Verify thumbnails display correctly**
4. **Consider removing** `local-api/` directory if not needed
5. **Document** the decision in project README

---

## üìù NOTES

- The TypeScript warnings shown in IDE are mostly style/optimization suggestions
- The actual build completed successfully with no blocking errors
- EC2 API is production-ready and already handling the thumbnail fix
- No conflicts found between coaches-dashboard and BodyF1rst-APIs repos
- All video data is in RDS database, accessible from both APIs

---

## ‚ú® CONCLUSION

**Primary Issue:** Misconfig in environment.ts pointing to wrong API
**Primary Solution:** Update to use EC2 API directly
**Time to Fix:** < 1 minute
**Impact:** Dashboard will work immediately after fix
