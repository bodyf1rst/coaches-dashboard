# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX - INFINITE THUMBNAIL LOOP

**Date:** October 8, 2025, 1:35 AM
**Issue:** 4000+ requests for default-thumb.png causing infinite loop

## THE REAL PROBLEM

Your screenshot showed **4357 requests** for thumbnails! This was caused by:

1. **Infinite Error Loop**: When thumbnail fails to load â†’ triggers `onImageError`
2. **Missing Fallback**: Tries `default-thumb.png` which doesn't exist
3. **Loop Continues**: Failed fallback triggers error again â†’ infinite loop
4. **Result**: Thousands of requests, browser hangs, videos don't load

## THE FIX

### Fixed in TypeScript (video-library.component.ts)

```typescript
onImageError(event: Event, video?: VideoMetadata): void {
  const target = event.target as HTMLImageElement;

  // âœ… PREVENT INFINITE LOOP - mark that we tried this image
  if ((target as any)._errorAttempted) {
    console.log('Image load failed permanently for:', video?.title);
    return; // Stop trying
  }
  (target as any)._errorAttempted = true;

  // Try fallback URLs if available
  if (video && (video as any).thumbnailFallbacks && (video as any).thumbnailFallbacks.length > 0) {
    const nextFallback = (video as any).thumbnailFallbacks.shift();
    target.src = nextFallback;
    (target as any)._errorAttempted = false; // Allow retry for new URL
  } else {
    // âœ… NO MORE default-thumb.png - just hide broken image
    target.style.display = 'none';
  }
}
```

**Key Changes:**
1. âœ… Track failed attempts with `_errorAttempted` flag
2. âœ… Stop after first failure (no infinite loop)
3. âœ… Hide broken images instead of trying non-existent default-thumb.png
4. âœ… Allow retry only for actual fallback URLs

## DEPLOYMENT

This file triggers Amplify auto-deploy for the frontend fix.

**Expected Result:**
- No more infinite thumbnail requests
- Failed thumbnails just hide (no broken image icon)
- Videos load normally
- Browser doesn't hang

## TESTING

After deployment completes:
1. Go to: https://admin-bodyf1rst.com/video-library
2. Open F12 â†’ Network tab
3. Refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R to clear cache)
4. Check request count - should be ~747 (one per video)
5. NOT 4000+!
